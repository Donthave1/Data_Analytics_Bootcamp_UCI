# Pyndas - Game Sales / School Rating Analysis

## Objective
For this assignment, two challenges present:

* HeroesOfPymoli: I need to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. 
* PyCitySchools: I will be analyzing the district-wide standardized test results. In the end, I will aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.


## Approach
Tools:

* Python - Pandas, Numpy


In HeroesOfPymoli, using Python libraries Pandas and Numpy to clean up data first. Then I selected key elements to demonstrate their significances. I choosed Player Count, Gender Demographics, and Ages to tie in with purchasing history. Then I ping out the top-spender, and also most-profitable in-game items.


In PyCitySchools, again using Python libraries Pandas and Numpy to clean up data first. Then I narrow down to key elements to demonstrate their significances. Find out all scool spending average, and student overall performance to compare schoold budgets affectness. 
I also ping out top performance school compared to bottom performance school to show the differences.
I narrow down further to each subjects (Math/Reading) scores to analysis the trends.
