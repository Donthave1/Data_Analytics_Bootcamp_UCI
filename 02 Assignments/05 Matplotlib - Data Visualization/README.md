# Matplotlib - Data Visualization

## Objective
For this assignment, two challenges present:

* Pyber: The given data contain every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type. Now I need to provide data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

* Pymaceuticals: In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. I will be analyznig the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.


## Approach
Tools:

* Python - Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy


In Pyber, we utilize the power of Python libraries Pandas and Numpy to clean up the data and organized it so it can be plotted through Matplotlib and present data visiualization shown below:
