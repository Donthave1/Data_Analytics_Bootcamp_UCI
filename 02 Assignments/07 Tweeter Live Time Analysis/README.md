# Tweeter Live Time Analysis

## Objective
Twitter has become a wildly sprawling jungle of informationâ€”140 characters at a time. Somewhere between 350 million and 500 million tweets are estimated to be sent out per day. With such an explosion of data, on Twitter and elsewhere, it becomes more important than ever to tame it in some way, to concisely capture the essence of the data.


## Approach
Tools:

* Python - Tweepy, json, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Request, DateTime

1. News Mood assignment

I created a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news outlets, and presented findings visually.
These are the following news organizations I choose to perform analysis on: BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times.

2. News Mood assignment

This assignment is the very first time I get to create my first bot to be scarping information and perform analysis by itself. So I was able to have the bot to reconized certain key word and also take in the handle provided by the requester, then digest the information to return a visual graph back to the requester.
