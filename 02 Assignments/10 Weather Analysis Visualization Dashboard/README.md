# Weather Analysis Visualization Dashboard

## Objective
For this homework, I created a visualization dashboard website using plotted weather data visualizations I've have done in the past assignment.
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and navigation bar are funcitional. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also created a landing page, a page for comparison of all of the plots, and another page to see the data used to build them.

All HTML/CSS/Boostrap scrips can be found on this GitHub page.
