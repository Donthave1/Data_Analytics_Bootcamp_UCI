## Objective
I am tasked to aggregate the data found in the [Citi Bike Trip History Logs](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) to build a data visualization dashboard.  I chosen timespan for year of 2018 to present my finding. 

Tools:

* Tableau, Excel


I am chosing the major three categories of Citi Bike: 
 
1. Total usage, and by how much is Subsciprtion customer v.s. short-term customer  
2. Seasonal Peak hour bike usage comparison  
3. Where is the most popular station people start their tirp? and where is the station where most people park their bike?  

Please take a look in my report to see the comparison chart.
