From the [Source](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), with a tons of data to look through, we have to utilize the power of data visualization to display graph for better comprehensive. I use a python script to generate routes to read into database via SQLAlchemy, then combine JavaScript to demonstarte where D3 + Plotly can produce great charts with very user friendly interaction.
