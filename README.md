# Data Analytics Bootcamp

Welcome to my repository for **Data Analytics Bootcamp class of 2018** at **University of California Irvine**. This is a 24 weeks of courses, where we participate in variety of individual and team exercises, working independently and in groups, both in the classroom and at home. The goal is to gain a comprehensive learning experience and true insight into a “day in the life” of a data professional.

This repository will contain all of the assignment, groupe projects, final project and any related resources.
